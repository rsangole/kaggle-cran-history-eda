# Introduction

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis of the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) historical data set. As you may already know, CRAN is a network of servers around the world which store code and documentation for the R packages over time. As of writing this EDA, CRAN had just over 18,000 packages available in it's repository.

[![CRAN Website](images/paste-715AEC83.png){width="693"}](https://cran.r-project.org)

[Heads or Tails](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails) has done a great job of grabbing historical data, cleaning it up and preparing it for us R enthusiasts. Read about the approach he followed in his [blogpost](https://heads0rtai1s.github.io/2022/07/22/kaggle-dataset-cran-packages/).

# Initial Setup {.tabset}

_Read through the initial setup in the 4 tabs below._

## Libraries {.tabset}

First, some I import some useful libraries and set some plotting defaults.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Data Manipulation
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(skimr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(urltools)

# Plots
library(ggplot2)
library(naniar)
library(packcircles)
library(ggridges)

# Tables
library(reactable)

# Settings
theme_set(theme_minimal(
  base_size = 14,
  base_family = "Menlo",
  plot.title.position = "plot"
))
```


## Read In {.tabset}

Let's start be reading in the data. There are two `CSV` files in this dataset. From his [dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/headsortails/r-package-history-on-cran):

-   `cran_package_overview.csv`: all R packages currently available through CRAN, with (usually) 1 row per package...
-   `cran_package_history.csv`: version history of virtually all packages in the previous table\...


```{r}
hist_dt <- read_csv(
  "../input/cran_package_history.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    package = col_character(),
    version = col_character(),
    date = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d"),
    repository = col_character()
  )
)
ov_dt <- read_csv(
  "../input/cran_package_overview.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    package = col_character(),
    version = col_character(),
    depends = col_character(),
    imports = col_character(),
    license = col_character(),
    needs_compilation = col_logical(),
    author = col_character(),
    bug_reports = col_character(),
    url = col_character(),
    date_published = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d"),
    description = col_character(),
    title = col_character()
  )
)
```

## Quick View {.tabset}

I love to take the first peek into a dataset with the amazing [`{skimr}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/index.html) package. We can see that we have the right data types set for all the columns, dates have been imported correctly. 

We can see in the `history` data that the 1st package reported on CRAN was in 22 years ago on _`r min(hist_dt$date)`!_  Furthermore, the `overview` tells us there's a package _{`r ov_dt$package[ov_dt$date_published == min(ov_dt$date_published, na.rm = T)][[1]]`}_ last published/updated on `r min(ov_dt$date_published, na.rm = TRUE)`.

While there's no missing data in the `history` dataset, there are a bunch of missing values in the `overview` dataset. Let's explore this a bit more.

```{r paged.print=FALSE}
skimr::skim(hist_dt)
skimr::skim(ov_dt)
```

## Data Quality {.tabset}

My favorite way of exploring missing data is to make it visible, using [Nick Tierney's](https://www.njtierney.com/about/) amazing [`{naniar}`](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) package. There are a few columns with missing data. Let's look at these more closely.

* `depends` and `imports` have roughly a quarter of the data as `<NA>`. These are packages which _roughly_ have no external dependencies. The difference between the two can get a bit complex; best to learn about it in Hadley's chapter [here](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies.html).
* Roughly half of `bug_reports` and `url` are missing. These don't seem to be data issues as much as authors who don't have a place to issue bugs or website for their package respectively.
* `date_published` has only 1 row with missing, which seems like a data quality spill.

```{r}
ov_dt |> 
  dplyr::arrange(date_published) |> 
  vis_miss()
```


# Interesting Questions

Since this is an open ended exploration - unlike other EDA with the purpose of building a predictive model - before I continue to the plotting, I'd like to posit some questions which will guide the flow of further work. The first five questions are from [Martin's blog](https://heads0rtai1s.github.io/2022/07/22/kaggle-dataset-cran-packages/), with further questions which I think would be interesting to explore.

1. How long did packages take from their first release to version 1.0?
1. Which packages have had the most version updates?
1. What type of packages were most frequent in different years?
1. Who are the most productive authors?
1. Can you predict the growth toward 2025?
1. What license is most used? Has there been a change over time?
1. How many packages use all CAPS, all small, or a mixture?
1. How have the dependencies & imports changed over time?
1. Which repositories do packages use? Github/Bitbucket etc. How do these vary over time?
1. Do packages have URLs for bug reports?
1. Is there any temporal patterns to when versions are submitted to CRAN?
1. Have titles & descriptions gotten longer over time?
1. Do authors use minor versions?


# Feature Development {.tabset}

To aid answering many of these, I first need to create a few new features in the `overview` data set. 

_Read about the feature development in the tabs below. We go from 12 columns to 29 columns in the `overview` data set._

## Version Numbers {.tabset}

Per the R package section in [Hadley's book](https://r-pkgs.org/lifecycle.html#version), _"an R package version is a sequence of at least two integers separated by either `.` or `-`. For example, `1.0` and `0.9.1-10` are valid versions, but `1` and `1.0-devel` are not"_. Typically, packages do follow the three number format of `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. I'm making an assumption this is true, just to simplify things. I have a feeling it'll capture most of the cases. 

This feature could help answer questions about version number progressions.

```{r}
split_versions <- function(dat) {
  stopifnot("version" %in% names(dat))
  
  dat |>
    separate(
      version,
      into =
        c("major", "minor", "patch"),
      sep = "\\.",
      extra = "merge", # for versions like 1.0.3-3000, keep the '3-3000' together in the 3rd col
      fill = "right",
      remove = FALSE
    )
}

ov_dt <- ov_dt |> split_versions()
hist_dt <- hist_dt |> split_versions()
head(hist_dt) |> 
  reactable(compact = TRUE)
```

## Dependies & Imports {.tabset}

For the last published version of the package, how many dependencies and/and imports does each package have? My hypothesis is that packages in the past relied on lesser dependencies since they were more likely than not written in base R. With the recent explosion of adoption of R, and the adoption of the tidyverse framework, more recent packages would have a larger set of dependencies.

```{r}
ov_dt <- ov_dt |> 
  mutate(
    # Dependencies
    num_dep = purrr::map_int(
      .x = depends,
      .f = function(x){
        x |> 
          stringr::str_split(",", simplify = TRUE) |> 
          length()
      }
    ),
    num_dep = ifelse(is.na(depends), 0, num_dep),
    # Imports
    num_imports = purrr::map_int(
      .x = imports,
      .f = function(x){
        x |> 
          stringr::str_split(",", simplify = TRUE) |> 
          length()
      }
    ),
    num_imports = ifelse(is.na(imports), 0, num_imports)
  )
glimpse(ov_dt, 100)
```

## Authors {.tabset}

How many authors did the latest publish have? Perhaps this could provide some insights into if package authors are collaborating more than they used to. Is the R community working together?

```{r}
ov_dt <- ov_dt |> 
  mutate(
    num_authors = purrr::map_int(
      .x = author,
      .f = function(x){
        x |> 
          stringr::str_split(",", simplify = TRUE) |> 
          length()
      }
    )
  )
glimpse(ov_dt, 100)
```

## Temporal {.tabset}

Temporal features typically useful for aggregation downstream.

```{r}
hist_dt <- hist_dt |> 
  mutate(
    year = lubridate::year(date),
    month = lubridate::month(date, label = TRUE),
    day = lubridate::day(date),
    wday = lubridate::wday(date, label = TRUE),
    yr_mon = sprintf("%d-%s", year, month),
    dt = lubridate::ym(paste0(year, "-", month))
  )
ov_dt <- ov_dt |> 
  filter(!is.na(date_published)) |>
  mutate(
    year = lubridate::year(date_published),
    month = lubridate::month(date_published, label = TRUE),
    day = lubridate::day(date_published),
    wday = lubridate::wday(date_published, label = TRUE),
    yr_mon = sprintf("%d-%s", year, month),
    dt = lubridate::ym(paste0(year, "-", month))
  )
glimpse(ov_dt, 100)
```

## Titles & Descriptions {.tabset}

How long are the titles and description fields in the latest package submissions? Any interesting trends over time?

```{r}
ov_dt <- ov_dt |>
  mutate(
    len_title = purrr::map_int(title, ~ stringr::str_count(.x, "\\w+")),
    len_desc = purrr::map_int(description, ~ stringr::str_count(.x, "\\w+"))
  )
glimpse(ov_dt, 100)
```

## Package Licenses {.tabset}

The raw dataset has `r ov_dt |> count(license) |> nrow()` unique levels for the `license` variable. 

```{r}
ov_dt |> 
  count(license) |> 
  reactable(compact = TRUE)
```

But many of being quite similar to each other, some binning is in order to extract some patterns. Here, I use the `case_when` to bin together similar licenses. (I'm no expert in these licenses. I'm sure I'm taking some liberties in the grouping here).

```{r}
ov_dt <- ov_dt |> 
  mutate(
    license_cleaned = case_when(
      str_detect(license, "^GPL-3") ~ "GPL-3",
      str_detect(license, "^GPL\\s\\([\\s\\d\\.<=>]*3") ~ "GPL-3",
      str_detect(license, "^GPL-2") ~ "GPL-2",
      str_detect(license, "^GPL\\s\\([\\s\\d\\.<=>]*2") ~ "GPL-2",
      str_detect(license, "^AGPL") ~ "AGPL",
      str_detect(license, "^LGPL") ~ "LGPL",
      str_detect(license, "Apache") ~ "Apache",
      str_detect(license, "BSD") ~ "BSD",
      str_detect(license, "LGPL") ~ "LGPL",
      str_detect(license, "MIT") ~ "MIT",
      str_detect(license, "CC0") ~ "CC0",
      license == "GPL" ~ "GPL",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
      # str_detect(license, "GNU") ~ "GNU", # Left these out after some trials with plots below
      # str_detect(license, "MPL") ~ "MPL",
      # str_detect(license, "Unlimited") ~ "Unlimited",
      # str_detect(license, "^CC") ~ "CC",
      )
  )
glimpse(ov_dt, 100)
```

## Domains {.tabset}

Which domains do package authors typically use? My guess is GitHub rules them all, but is that true? Can we see any rise of other offerings like GitLab or BitBucket?

```{r}
ov_dt <- ov_dt |>
  mutate(url_domain = map_chr(url,
                              ~ {
                                if (is.na(.x))
                                  return(NA)
                                else
                                  return(url_parse(.x)$domain)
                              }),
         bug_domain = map_chr(bug_reports,
                              ~ {
                                if (is.na(.x))
                                  return(NA)
                                else
                                  return(url_parse(.x)$domain)
                              }))
glimpse(ov_dt, 100)
```

# Graphical EDA

Now that I have the data sets prepared and ready, it's time for the fun part - being creative and creating some interesting visuals! Let's attack those questions one at a time.

1. How long did packages take from their first release to version 1.0?
1. Which packages have had the most version updates?
1. What type of packages were most frequent in different years?
1. Who are the most productive authors?
1. Can you predict the growth toward 2025?
1. What license is most used? Has there been a change over time?
1. How many packages use all CAPS, all small, or a mixture?
1. Which repositories do packages use? Github/Bitbucket etc. How do these vary over time?
1. Do packages have URLs for bug reports?
1. Is there any temporal patterns to when versions are submitted to CRAN?
1. Have titles & descriptions gotten longer over time?
1. Do authors use minor versions?

## Package Dependencies

_Q: How have the dependencies & imports changed over time?_

Taking the last published year-month combo for the active packages in the repo, I can calculate the median values for dependencies and imports. Medians will be robust against outliers, while also conviniently giving us whole numbers. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ov_dt |> 
  select(date_published, dt, num_imports) |> 
  timetk::pad_by_time(date_published, .pad_value = 0) |> 
  mutate(dt = lubridate::ym(paste0(lubridate::year(date_published), "-", lubridate::month(date_published)))) |> 
  group_by(dt) |>
  mutate(median_imports = median(num_imports)) -> plot_dt

plot_dt |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = dt)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = num_imports), alpha = 0.01) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = median_imports), color = "red") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "'%y", minor_breaks = NULL, expand = c(NA, 0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(minor_breaks = NULL) +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x.bottom = element_line(size = 0.5, colour = "gray"),
    axis.ticks.y.left = element_line(size = 0.5, colour = "gray"),
    plot.margin = margin(0,50,0,50)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "How have `imports` changed over time?",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +
  annotate(
    "text",
    x = max(plot_dt$date_published)+lubridate::ddays(90),
    y = max(plot_dt$median_imports),
    label = sprintf("Median: %d", max(plot_dt$median_imports)),
    vjust = 1,
    hjust = 0,
    color = "red"
  )
```


```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
deps <- ov_dt |> 
  select(year, len_desc, len_title) |> 
  arrange(-year) |> 
  filter(!is.na(year), year > 2008) |> 
  mutate(year = factor(year, levels = seq(2008, 2022)))
deps |>
  pivot_longer(-year) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = year, x = value, fill = name)) +
  stat_density_ridges(
    bandwidth = 4,
    jittered_points = F,
    position = position_points_jitter(height = 0),
                      point_shape = "|",
                      point_size = 2,
                      size = 0.25,
                      scale = .95,
                      quantile_lines = TRUE, 
                      quantiles = 2,
                      alpha = 0.7, 
                      rel_min_height = 0.01) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,200), expand = c(0,0)) +
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off") +
  theme_ridges(center = TRUE)
```

-   Have titles & descriptions gotten longer over time?

```{r}

-   Do packages have URLs for bug reports?

```{r}
ov_dt |> 
  group_by(dt) |> 
  count(url_exist = is.na(url)) |>  
  ggplot(aes(x= dt, y = n, color = url_exist)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.3, se = FALSE) +
  theme_light()
ov_dt |> 
  group_by(dt) |> 
  count(url_exist = is.na(bug_reports)) |>  
  ggplot(aes(x= dt, y = n, color = url_exist)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.3, se = FALSE) +
  theme_light()
```

-   Which repositories do packages use? Github/Bitbucket etc. How do these vary over time?

```{r}
ov_dt |> 
  filter(domain != "") |> 
  mutate(domain = forcats::fct_lump_min(domain, 20)) |> 
  group_by(dt) |> 
  count(domain) |>  
  ggplot(aes(x= dt, y = n, color = domain)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.5, se = FALSE) +
  theme_light()
```

```{r}
ov_dt |> 
   filter(domain != "") |> 
  mutate(domain = forcats::fct_lump_min(domain, 20)) |> 
    count(domain) |> 
  mutate(label = sprintf("%s\n%d", domain, n)) |> 
    arrange(runif(1:n())) |> 
  plot_bubbles(
    .scale =50,
    plot_radius = 6,
    bubble_radius = 0.4,
    alpha = 0.2,
    maxiter = 1000
  )
```

-   Is there any temporal patterns to when versions are submitted to CRAN?

```{r}
ov_dt |> 
  filter(!is.na(dt), dt < "2022-07-01") |> 
  count(dt) |> 
  arrange(dt) |> 
  timetk::pad_by_time(dt, .by = "month", .pad_value = 0) |> 
  ggplot(aes(dt, n)) +
  geom_line()

ov_dt |> 
  filter(!is.na(dt), dt < "2022-07-01") |> 
  count(dt) |> 
  arrange(dt) |> 
  timetk::pad_by_time(dt, .by = "month", .pad_value = 0) -> xdat
timetk::plot_seasonal_diagnostics(xdat, dt, log(n), .interactive = FALSE)

timetk::plot_stl_diagnostics(xdat |> filter(dt > "2018-01-01", dt < "2022-07-01"), dt, n, .interactive = FALSE, .feature_set = c("observed", "season", "trend", "remainder"))
```
